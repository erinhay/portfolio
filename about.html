	<h3>About Me</h3>
	<p>Hi, and welcome to my blog! My name is Erin, but you can call me Hayes.</p><br>
	<p>I am a junior at the University of Pennsylvania studying physics, with a concentration in astrophysics, with minors in design and math. In addition to the BA, I will be submatriculating and recieving my MS in physics. On campus, I am a member of Arts House Dance Company, West Philly Tutoring Project, Women in Physics, and Penn Astronomical Student Association. In addition, I work in the Department of Physics & Astronomy under Masao Sako as a research assistant.</p><br>
	<p>When I'm not studying, I can be found attending the ballet and the orchestra, exploring coffee shops around Philadelphia, or curling up with a good book - of course, always with friends. Join me on this blog as I share the highlights of it all! </p>

	<h3>Why "Hazey Highlights?"</h3>
	<p>When I was in 4th grade, my dad started a blog for me to document my field hockey games, piano recitals, and dance performances. He called it Hazey Highlights, in honor of my elementary school nickname, Hazey. While the site hasn't survived to today, the sentiment lives on through the new Hazey Highlights, curated by yours truly, Hazey.</p>
