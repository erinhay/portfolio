	<h3>Such a Fun Age</h3>
	<img align="right" class="cover-right" width="350" src="./assets/bookcovers/funage.jpg"><h4>by Kiley Reid | February, 2021</h4><br>
	<p>Kiley Reid’s debut novel <em>Such a Fun Age</em> was an incredibly relevant depiction not just of “being black in America,” but of the diversity of experiences that phrase encompasses. The novel follows a year in the life of Emira Tucker, during which time she works as a babysitter for the Chamberlain family. Like many twenty-somethings, Emira doesn’t have her life “figured out” leaving her often feeling lost and confused as to who she is. The book is not about how she finds herself, but instead about those people that influence her decisions about who she will become. Among those characters are her best friend, Zara, her boss, Alix, her new (white) boyfriend, Kelley, and Alix’s (black) best friend, Tamara. Each of these characters believe they know what’s best for Emira without being able to recognize their own biases in their relationship to Emira.</p>
	<p>The relationship I found most interesting to read was that between Emira and Tamara, who only meet a handful of times through Alix. While both characters are black, their experiences of their race are entirely different. Tamara is a successful principal at a NYC private school who was very privileged in how she grew up and the lifestyle she leads. Of course, that is not to discount the hard work she put in to get to that point in her life, only to point out that her experience was very different than Emira’s, who grew up in the midwest in a family that has always made money by using their hands, as is described in the novel. As Alix tries to influence Emira’s life, she turns to Tamara for advice. While not altogether a negative thing, neither Alix nor Tamara acknowledge the fact that they might not know what’s best for Emira. As a (white) reader, I similarly fell into Alix’s mindset of “Tamara knows what’s best because she’s also black” for the majority of the book, before realizing the flaws in this mindset. The way Reid orchestrates this realization in readers is really artful and has the effect of forcing the reader to take a step back and evaluate their own biases in reading the book.</p>
	<p>Of course, that relationship is not the only one that makes the reader think, but I did particularly appreciate how it highlights the importance of recognizing the individuality of black people, despite the experiences they may share because of their race. As conversations of race have progressed, I think this point is particularly important to keep in mind, so that those who are not black do not fall into the trap of generalizing experiences and thus overstepping boundaries of what they know. Because being “woke,” or privy to the struggles of the black community, is not something that you can check off a list and be done with. It is a constant effort to understand the differences in everyone’s experiences. While we are moving in the right direction with respect to race, there is still so much progress to be made, which Reid makes clear in her smooth, but punchy first novel, <em>Such a Fun Age</em>.</p><br>

	<h3>The Reluctant Fundamentalist</h3>
	<img align="right" class="cover-right" width="350" src="./assets/bookcovers/fundamentalis.jpg"><h4>by Mohsin Hamid | January, 2021</h4><br>
	<p>I have been considering the idea of nationality and maybe more accurately nationalism in the wake of a catastrophic Trump presidency and a brilliant 2019 album by Coldplay. I don’t see a reason to get political on this platform, as it exists right now, but I will get into a little bit of why Coldplay’s album, “Everyday Life” has been so moving to me in this context. While so often we focus on what makes us different from people with different skin tones, accents, traditions, religions, etc than us, this album encourages us to see how we are similar, and maybe more so how inhumane our treatment of those identified as “others” is. Achieved by combining languages from French to English to Arabic with sounds coming from those places and beyond, the album is so successful for its blending of what would be considered vastly different musical styles into a record with a strong and cohesive overarching message.</p>
	<p>That we should all begin to consider ourselves as global citizens first, rather than of a particular country, was not necessarily the takeaway of Hamid’s <em>The Reluctant Fundamentalist</em>, but the novel certainly brought the idea of nationalism to the forefront. The work’s Pakistani main character, Changez, recounts to a nameless American stranger the story of the five years he spent in the US, first as a student at Princeton and then working as a consultant in New York, during which the terrorist attacks of 9/11 occur. Changez grapples with his split identity as a Pakistani and an American and how to balance the two internally when they are very much at odds on the global scale. Woven in with this personal struggle is a love story that is equally frustrating and emotional and bits of conversation in the present day that give minimal information about the identity of the stranger.</p>
	<p>Together this narrative forms a smooth and fast-paced novel that shows off the uniqueness and efficacy of Hamid’s writing style. It takes some adjusting to – I believe I was able to enjoy the writing of <em>The Reluctant Fundamentalist</em> more having already read a work of Hamid’s – but it is so powerful in its subtlety once the reader has. By having the main character tell his story without much input from his partner of conversation, or any other character for that matter, the reader gets a very biased picture of Changez’ life in the US. Of course, our narrator is trustworthy, but he brings along his own set of ideas developed as a result of the way he was raised. I don’t mean to condone some of his thoughts, only acknowledge that his story of 9/11 is unique from the born-and-raised American’s telling of the story.</p>
	<p>To get the perspective of the “other” side is a first for many reading the novel, and incredibly eye-opening for that reason. In the US, we are taught only one version of our history and not given the tools to analyze how that history might be different if told from another’s perspective. Hamid forces American readers into the position of “other” almost giving us a taste of our own medicine. This flip-flopped scenario is not what I mean by identifying as a global citizen, but I do this it is incredibly important to hear as a step towards greater compassion for humans, regardless of their nationality. To give others a place to voice their perspective, and make an effort to understand, is the least we can do to advance ourselves as global citizens.</p>
	<p>It is no surprise that <em>The Reluctant Fundamentalist</em> was nominated for the Man Booker Prize in 2008. At once shockingly simple and deeply layered, Hamid’s second novel was so wonderful to unfold. I will continue reading analyses of the meaning behind symbols in the book, the significance of the work’s major themes, and so on because I know I haven’t yet gotten all there is to understand from the book. I would highly recommend it.</p><br>

	<h3>The Maltese Falcon</h3>
	<img align="right" class="cover-right" width="350" src="./assets/bookcovers/falcon.jpg"><h4>by Dashiell Hammett | January, 2021</h4><br>
	<p>I wouldn’t say that mystery or detective fiction are my favorite genres, but I do seem to be reading a lot of them recently! In contrast to <em>The Searcher</em> or <em>Death in her Hands</em>, both of which were published in the past year, Hammett’s <em>The Maltese Falcon</em> is a classic, published in 1930. Its age is very apparent from the onset of the novel, with degrading descriptions of women and scenes that would likely be considered verbal, and at some points physical, harassment in workplaces today. Of course, if you’re able to look past these faults – the jury is still out on where I stand – you will find a fast-paced and smart little story. The writing is blunt, but surprisingly descriptive. Each scene is vividly laid out for the reader, although the language used to do so is simple and straightforward. The characters have an interesting dimensionality to them that has the reader constantly questioning what they know, which is perfect for a story revolving around lies and trickery.</p>
	<p>However, the constantly condescending main character, Sam Spade, was someone I couldn’t like, making it difficult for me to enjoy the ins and outs of the actual mystery of the Maltese falcon. As a detective, he is an understandably shady character, but his infidelity to anyone in the novel, literally any other character, meant there were no moments of forgiveness for the guy. For some his slick mind that was always one step ahead of everyone around him, including me on many occasions, might have been enough forgiveness for some, but it didn’t do it for me. He couldn’t have been the man he was without being kind of an awful person, so there’s nothing that really could have been different, but I still couldn’t get past him when reading the novel.</p>
	<p>As such, I can’t say this was a favorite book of mine, or even a favorite mystery of mine, but someone that appreciates detective novels more than I do would probably get a lot more enjoyment out of it than I did. Personally, time was too much against it with respect to gender roles for me to fully appreciate the plotline, but that is not to say that <em>The Maltese Falcon</em> doesn’t have its place, with appropriate context, in literature.</p><br>

	<h3>The Searcher</h3>
	<img align="right" class="cover-right" width="350" src="./assets/bookcovers/searcher.jpg"><h4>by Tana French | January, 2021</h4><br>
	<p><em>The Searcher</em>, Tana French’s newest Irish mystery novel, is the second work I’ve read of hers, after <em>The Witch Elm</em>. Her 2020 work has earned French even more acclaim, for reasons I very much see, but I don’t know that I’ll be reading more of her work in the future. I have made it very clear through these little reviews that I enjoy character-driven over plot-driven novels, so mysteries, which earn their value from the complexity of their plots, are never as satisfying for me as they might be for others. <em>The Searcher</em> tackles the story of an Chicago-born ex-cop, Cal, who moves to a small town in Ireland to start a new life after his divorce from his wife. Because of his “outsider” status, it takes Cal some time to become integrated into life in this small, close-knit town. His slow acclimation was mirrored in a very slow start to the novel, which initially made it difficult for me to keep reading. As the novel picked up its pace, though, I did become more invested in the solving of the mystery of a disappeared teenager, much as Cal does.</p>
	<p>Woven through this plot is commentary on the broken US police system, which was very well done in my opinion. Through Cal, French highlights the experience of a cop who grapples with his place in a system that disproportionately targets people of color. French masterfully brings the subject to the forefront of the reader’s mind without being aggressive in messaging for one side or another. I thought this was the most effective part of the novel. There are some other moments that feel like an attempt at social commentary, particularly related to gender and sexuality, that didn’t feel as considered. That said, it is commendable that French is beginning to make space for characters that don’t fit into traditional gender roles, but in this case it did feel a bit forced to me. As such, some of French’s choices with respect to the plot were less convincing for me.</p>
	<p>Of course, the plot-heavy nature of mystery novels did not prevent French from some beautiful descriptions of the idyllic Irish countryside. I very much enjoyed seeing the gorgeous greenery surrounding Cal’s home, as well as picturing the quirky pub in town and its eclectic cast of characters. French is thorough in her writing, always giving a good image of the scene. There is a lot to enjoy about <em>The Searcher</em>, but I don’t think this fully extends to the inner thoughts and feelings of the characters. As mentioned, Cal has some nice moments of reflection, but the 3rd person narrator prevents a full delve into his inner-workings. In addition, French sets up the novel so that the reader is just as much on the outside as Cal, which is important for the plot, but it prevents the reader from getting to know the characters as well, which is disappointing for me. Once you’re into the world, <em>The Searcher</em> is a really nice read that brings together mystery, social commentary, and descriptive writing. But it is first and foremost a mystery, so let that inform your choice of whether or not to pick it up.</p><br>

	<h3>Death in Her Hands</h3>
	<img align="right" class="cover-right" width="350" src="./assets/bookcovers/death.jpg"><h4>by Ottessa Moshfegh | December, 2020</h4><br>
	<p>I have applauded Ottessa Moshfegh in the past for her ability to push the boundaries of what a novel can be in her prior works – a quality that is so powerful and rare in artists. <em>Death in her Hands</em> certainly follows suit, with a twisty plotline, experimental methods of character development, and discussion of taboo subject matter. I appreciated all the things that make Moshfegh’s newest novel unique from any literature I’ve read, even her own earlier writing, but I can’t say it came together to be an enjoyable or rewarding read for me personally this time around. While she is usually an author that can masterfully draw up strange and interesting characters with unexpected motivations and desires, this ability of hers fell short for me in <em>Death in her Hands</em>. The way she explored character, specifically main characters Vesta and Magda, felt almost amature this time around. Of course, the borderline clunkiness of the writing could be perceived by some as genius for having never been done before, but I wasn’t overwhelmed by the beauty of its newness. It was interesting, but fell flat for me in the end.</p>
	<p>The novel revolves around its characters, in typical Moshfegh fashion, so without a strong connection to them I couldn’t get comfortable in the plot. The plot existed for the most part in Vesta’s mind, but was woven with moments of her interacting with the world around her. I am at a loss for words for how to best describe the disconnect that existed between these two plots, but it confused me in the sense that I couldn’t orient myself within the novel. As such, the ending was surprising yes for its unexpectedness, but more so for all the loose ends left on the other side of the plot. I was left unsatisfied by the ending within Vesta’s mind and the lack of one outside of it. Although one could argue a literary significance to her choice to end the novel without any definitive answers, there was nothing well-developed enough in the rest of the novel to make a strong point in that respect.</p>
	<p>With that said, this book has not stopped haunting me from the moment I started reading. My mind constantly wanders to its most horrific, avante-garde, or twisted moments. Having watched a few interviews with Moshfegh, although not specifically about this novel, I think she would say that the novel achieved its goal then, regardless of whether I liked it or not. In that sense, I can’t disagree with her, but regardless I don’t think I’ll be recommending it to any friends any time soon. If you’re looking for an interesting character study by the talented and daring Moshfegh, I would stick with <em>Eileen</em> or <em>My Year of Rest and Relaxation</em>. I found much more reward in those works than <em>Death in her Hands</em>.</p><br>

	<h3>Anna Karenina</h3>
	<img align="right" class="cover-right" width="350" src="./assets/bookcovers/annak.jpg"><h4>by Leo Tolstoy | December, 2020</h4><br>
	<p>Considering Tolstoy’s <em>Anna Karenina</em> is a whopping 800 pages long, there is a lot that can be discussed regarding the novel. The more philosophically-inclined might prefer that I focus on the symbolism of the train in a modernizing world; feminists might want an analysis of how gender affects one’s experience of society, including alienation from it; the religious might desire a study of Tolstoy’s views on religion and how they influenced the novel. I could spend hours discussing any or all of these subjects, but seeing as I have no partner for conversation, I will remain in my niche and focus on the literary significance of the novel. As mentioned, <em>Anna Karenina</em> is a long book, to say the least. At times, you are very aware of its length, but for the most part this didn’t deter my reading. The writing is so smooth – I want to make a reference to a smooth whiskey here, but I don’t have the life experience for that yet haha – that it is really easy to read. Especially having just finished reading Doestoevsky, who is known as a particularly ragged and rough writer, <em>Anna Karenina</em> was a very welcome breath of fresh air in the sense of how the novel read.</p>
	<p>Furthermore, with such a long novel, the reader gets to see the development of Tolstoy’s characters over several years of trials and tribulations. One of my favorite parts of reading the novel, then, was noticing how my feelings towards each character changed – and change they did. Stiva, an initially charismatic, easy-going, and popular guy, albeit having many flaws, was impossible not to enjoy reading at the beginning of the novel. Watching his hubris grow over the novel, though, made it difficult to like him by the end. On the other hand, his sister, Anna, was someone I could hardly stand initially. As the reader gets deeper into her mind, though, my sympathy for her situation grew immensely. Of course, that sentiment does not hold for everyone who reads her character, but a change in feeling, regardless of the specifics of  it, is sure for everyone I’ve talked to about the book. Tolstoy masterfully facilitates this experience for the reader by creating characters of such depth. Their depth makes them indistinguishable from real people, which allows the reader to find particular comfort in them. Because you are so vividly able to see yourself, or pieces of yourself, in these characters, you are able to reflect on your own values, fears, tendencies, thoughts, passions, etc from an outside perspective. In this way, Tolstoy provides grounds for the reader to grow as much as his characters do. The only other author who I have read with this ability is Virginia Woolf. I think particularly of <em>Mrs. Dalloway</em> because it is a favorite of mine, but scholars have traced the influence of Tolstoy on a number of Woolf’s other works as well.</p>
	<p>I am not sure of the overarching point of this “review” of sorts, besides to say that if you, like me, enjoy reading intense characters who will teach you something about yourself, <em>Anna Karenina</em> is certainly a book for you. Of course, there are so many other important things to draw out of the novel, but only those who appreciate the artistry of writing and character development will have the capacity to enjoy it to its fullest.</p><br>

	<h3>Interpreter of Maladies</h3>
	<img align="right" class="cover-right" width="350" src="./assets/bookcovers/maladies.jpg"><h4>by Jhumpa Lahiri | November, 2020</h4><br>
	<p>Since reading, and greatly enjoying, Lahiri’s <em>The Namesake</em> in high school, I have wanted to read more of her writing. It was only recently that I got around to picking up her Pulitzer Prize winning collection of short stories entitled <em>Interpreter of Maladies</em> though. Having never read in full a book of short stories, I wasn’t sure what to expect, but Lahiri exceeded whatever expectations I even began to have and then some. As I remember, her writing is at once detailed and straightforward – a balance that is difficult to strike, but my favorite to read when achieved. This balance allows the reader inside the minds of each character without being overbearing, allowing you to insert yourself in small ways into the stories. Her writing leaves me with the feeling that communication is happening not only with what is being said, but also with what is going unsaid. Considering her only medium is words, I find this to be a fascinating quality of hers.</p>
	<p>Besides each story being a gorgeous conglomeration of words, they flow together seamlessly, which I don’t know I was expecting from a collection of short stories. While each is a free-standing entity, and stunning in each of their own ways, they are organized together in such a way that gives a beautiful arc to the reader’s experience of them. Despite taking place at different times and places across the globe, there is a sense of connection through the common experiences of hope, longing, unhappiness, grief, and love. The only thing I can think to compare the separate but perfectly together feeling of these stories is a good album. Although each story, or song, can stand alone, it contributes to a bigger idea that can only be realized when you take a step back and notice the subtle moments of commonality. Personally, I found this bigger idea to be one of persistence and humanity in <em>Interpreter of Maladies</em>, but I am sure that differs from person to person.</p>
	<p>If you have hesitated to get into the short story game, I would highly recommend Lahiri’s <em>Interpreter of Maladies</em> as a way to start. While the book provides rich grounds for deeper literary analysis, it is not a collection that requires supplementary reading to understand it, making it accessible to anyone. Furthermore, the themes it deals with are so common that no matter your background or lived experience, you will be able to find a home somewhere in the stories. Art, including literature, is most beautiful to me when it is breaking down barriers between people and I believe this work does exactly that. I look forward to reading it again in the future to see how the stories change under my older and, supposedly by that point, wiser eyes. It is one I already know I will come back to again and again.</p><br>

	<h3>Fathers and Children</h3>
	<img align="right" class="cover-right" width="350" src="./assets/bookcovers/turgenev.jpg"><h4>by Ivan Turgenev | October, 2020</h4><br>
	<p>I was more torn than the class poll could’ve shown about whether or not Turgenev wrote <em>Fathers and Children</em> in favor of the fathers or the children. My vote for fathers was based mostly on the different endings for Pavel and Bazarov, with Pavel’s not dying being the deciding factor. Pavel was able to escape to a world he constructs for himself in which he only sees those with similar values as himself and indulges in romantic poetry, art, and music. While it is not a perfect world, as Pavel isn’t in Russia or in touch with his family, it is at least a comfortable one for him. On the other hand, Bazarov doesn’t get to live on in a world with values aligned with his own, but maybe he gets to die on in that world? In later thinking about my snap judgement for the poll, death for a nihilist like Bazarov may be the equivalent of Dresden for old-world aristocrats like Pavel. In both cases, it is not the most ideal situation, but at least each respective character won’t have to deal with those with opposing views to their own. In Dresden, Pavel upholds traditional values of honor and morality and in death, Bazarov, as a good nihilist, rejects all emotions and human individuality. I’m not sure whether this changes my answer, but it certainly isn’t as clear cut of a win for fathers as the poll showed (at least for me).</p>
	<p>Like <em>A Double Life</em> last week, <em>Father and Children</em> gets into much more interesting and well-considered character development than many of the prior works we read. I’ve come to realize that deep and complex characters are what grab my attention the most in a book, so I look forward to seeing where that goes for the rest of the 19th century and our course.</p><br>
	<p><em></em></p>

	<br><br><br><br><br>

	<h3>A Double Life</h3>
	<img align="right" class="cover-right" width="350" src="./assets/bookcovers/pavlova.jpg"><h4>by Karolina Pavlova | October, 2020</h4><br>
	<p>I really really enjoyed Pavlova’s <em>A Double Life</em>. As shallow as their lives may be, the women in this book are (for the first time!) given deeply considered characters. Watching Cecily’s, Vera’s, Olga’s and Madame Valitskaia’s characters develop over the course of the novel was interesting in a way I don’t think we’ve seen so far in Russian Literature. I especially enjoyed Cecily’s growth both into and out of her dreams and all that they’re associated with. On the surface, she is growing out of her childish dreams and tendencies through her marriage to Dmitry. I mean, the end Chapter 9 is devoted to her realization that she’s sleeping for the last time in her childhood bedroom. Pavlova writes on page 109 that Cecily’s “dreams were changing unaccountably … All her childish, bright, peacefulness, so proudly scorned, suddenly flashed before her like a priceless but lost treasure,” a direct reference back to the passage about time we looked at on page 63.</p>
	<p>However, as we started to get at in class on Thursday, I don’t know that she is as simple of a character as that. Cecily has been in a “mental corset” because of her mother’s close watch over her thoughts and actions. As such, her childhood hasn’t allowed her to dream freely as children should. So while she is growing out of childhood, she is somehow growing more into her dreams, which is almost a contradiction. This contradiction is mirrored in the increasing intensity of the poems at the end of each chapter, as well as the increasing awareness Cecily has of her dreams towards the end of the novel. The reader is left feeling bad for Cecily, and I wonder if this picture of her has something to do with it. When she finally gains some freedom, it is at a point where she is almost too old to enjoy it. Her dreams at the point she’s realizing them will only set her up for disappointment. The complexity of Cecily’s character, and similarly the characters of Vera, Olga, and Madame Valitskaia, makes her so much more human than any of the other characters we’ve seen. I really appreciated that about <em>A Double Life</em>, especially considering the other works we’ve read. I look forward to getting more complex characters in the upcoming novels we’ll be reading.</p><br>

	<h3>A Thousand Splendid Suns</h3>
	<img align="right" class="cover-right" width="350" src="./assets/bookcovers/suns.jpg"><h4>by Khaled Hosseini | October, 2020</h4><br>
	<p>Hosseini’s <em>A Thousand Splendid Suns</em> had my heart in the palm of its hand from the first word of the book. The novel, in my opinion, can best be described as a collection of overlapping love stories, whether that be the love between a mother and daughter, brother and sister, the closest of friends, or young lovers. It struggles with a lack of love and unhealthy ways of expressing love, as well as the loss of love. It celebrates the triumph of true love and love as a way to heal. Part of me hates the book for this reason - it made my heart flutter in a way that reminded me it has never been broken. Despite this, I couldn’t help but think that the ending of a story doesn’t make the middle any less valuable. The pain that unconditional love can bring must be worth it for reasons - feelings, rather - that I can’t describe in words. Naive, maybe, but that’s the only way I know how to approach the world. Maybe that’s the only way I’m supposed to know how to approach the world right now. Excuse me for being emotional and dramatic, but that’s just who I am.</p>
	<p>It was more than just the stories of love which affected me about this book, though. Although my experience of the War in Afghanistan was more removed than any of the characters in the book (by far), my uncle fought there for a year, details of which I remember clearly. Most notable was the construction paper chain, which was 365 links long, that my cousins looped around their house and unraveled day by day. The fear of loss was present in their house, just as it was for Laila, Mariam, and all the characters in <em>A Thousand Splendid Suns</em>. I was struck by the common experience of fear that is created by wars and the lack of choice anyone gets in the situation. My family - my aunt - didn’t choose to love someone who would be sent 10,000 km away to fight in a war he had no personal relation to, just as the families in Kabul did not choose to live somewhere that would one day be bombed endlessly and ruthlessly for reasons in which they were not involved. It frustrates me endlessly that a select few people should be allowed the power to let their differences create such turmoil for “normal” people like you and me. “Normal” people who are loved or have been loved or will be loved so deeply. Of course, I understand that this black and white way of looking at the situation is even more naive than my thoughts on love. Again, I can’t help but believe there is value in my naivety in some way, though.</p>
	<p>Because of the complexity of thoughts this story raised in me, I’m looking forward to picking up Hosseini’s other novel, <em>The Kite Runner</em>, as soon as possible. Although the reality of his characters is so different from anything I will experience in my life, Hosseini was able to stir up such raw emotions through <em>A Thousand Splendid Suns</em> that I can only want to read more of his work. Stories like these remind me of how little power I have in the world, but empower me to take that little power and make something of it. If nothing else, I can be more human, try to better understand the world around me, and make it a priority to help others find their place in it. I don’t know that I’ve achieved any, let alone all, of those goals yet, but for now, I will keep reading.</p><br>

	<h3>All The Light We Cannot See</h3>
	<img align="right" class="cover-right" width="350" src="./assets/bookcovers/light.jpg"><h4>by Anthony Doerr | September, 2020</h4><br>
	<p>The experience of crying has changed a lot for me over these past six months. With a global pandemic constantly in the back of my mind, tumultuous race relations worsening every day, an election that I can barely bear thinking about no matter which direction it swings, and an overwhelming feeling of disconnect between myself and the world, the need to cry is completely understandable. And I am not one to shy away from crying normally. Somehow, though, because of how extended these stressors have been, I haven’t been able to find any release in tears - they have become such a futile resistance. For that reason, I was absolutely needing Doerr’s <em>All The Light We Cannot See</em> in this moment. This Pulitzer Prize winning book is enchanting in its writing - each short chapter was clearly very thoughtfully and meaningfully created. Each and every sentence was beautiful to read, imagine, and experience and none of them were in the book without reason. Furthermore, because the chapters are short, you can move through the 500 page monster in a matter of days. I found this to be especially true by the end, at which point my eyes couldn’t move fast enough to finish each page.</p>
	<p>Like I mentioned before, though, the biggest thing this book gave me, besides chills on several occasions, was a good, genuine cry. It wasn’t for my world or any of the pain that exists only here, but for something bigger. Doerr does a brilliant job weaving together the stories of a young, French, blind girl, named Marie-Laure and a young, German boy Werner as they live through World War II. Naturally, you can expect the book to be a tear-jerker, but the carefulness of its writing makes it all the more impactful. The chapters alternate between Marie-Laure, Werner, and a few other characters as the narrator, giving the reader an acute sense of how much can be happening in just a few people’s lives at the same time. Doerr doesn’t just let the moments of intersection of these lives be powerful for what they are, but elevates their significance with his attention to detail in how those intersections come about and the lasting effects they have on the character’s lives. Subsequently, the ending of the novel is perfect in what it needs to be. It’s not easy to take, but if it were, it would be unbelievable. The reader is given just enough to make it through glad to have read such a masterful book.</p>
	<p>Masterful is the best way to describe <em>All The Light We Cannot See</em>. It zeros in on one story to help you realize how incredible and overwhelming the world can be. Personally, having one story consisting of a few characters I felt so strongly about was what I needed to make manageable the flood of emotions and anxieties that I’ve been feeling recently. Not because this story is much more tragic than anything that is happening to me (although it is), but because of the commonality of emotions such as fear, anger, confusion, tiredness, and sadness in times when everything you know is not as it should be. I was very grateful to take comfort in knowing that someone else has felt this way too. The nod to science throughout the book - the title, <em>All The Light We Cannot See</em>, has an interesting scientific tilt even in its poetic flow - also made me happy. Science is how I relate to the world and so I appreciated reading about characters that had a similar experience. In conclusion, Doerr’s <em>All The Light We Cannot See</em> is an incredible recommendation that I am glad to have finally shared in the experience of reading.</p><br>

	<h3>A Hero of Our Time</h3>
	<h4>by Mikhail Lermontov | September, 2020</h4><br>
	<p>I was overall less moved by Lermontov’s <em>A Hero of Our Time</em> than Pushkin’s <em>Eugene Onegin</em>. Of course, I might chalk it up to not having the physical book (e-books just aren’t the same for me) or reading it knowing that Lermontov looked up to Pushkin and borrowed some of his techniques, but most of all I think I just could not sympathize with Pechorin. I’ve read plenty of books in which I didn’t like the main character, but found them interesting/very enjoyable for the way that character was explored or described or acted, etc. That wasn’t really the case for me with <em>A Hero of Our Time</em>. While at times there were great descriptions of characters and settings, I found the prose to be generally kind of dry. The series of short stories was an interesting way of exploring a character, but still didn’t manage to keep my attention very well. Maybe because Pechorin didn’t really grow or change over the course of those stories. He was nosy and annoying to begin in Taman and cold and (again) annoying to end in Bela/Maksim Maksimich. What bothered me most, though, was his inability to take responsibility for his own actions. He pretty much blames his killing of Grushnitski on fate and would probably hold that Bela’s death was the fault of Kazbich or Azamat (or his horse or something).</p>
	<p>With that being said, I found it very valuable to go back and read the author’s introduction again after having finished the book, as we did in class today. It did provide Lermontov’s motivation for writing a character that really isn’t that likable, which is necessary to get across when an author chooses to do that with their protagonist. I think I still stand by my indifference to the novel though. There have been better explorations of disagreeable characters (to continue on my Ottessa Moshfegh kick, her debut novel <em>Eileen</em> is brilliant) and more gripping adventure stories. For this reason, <em>A Hero of Our Time</em> wasn’t my favorite, but I can appreciate what he was trying to do with the novel. I definitely couldn’t write anything that is read 100+ years later, so kudos to him for that!</p><br>

	<h3>My Year of Rest and Relaxation</h3>
	<img align="right" class="cover-right" width="350" src="./assets/bookcovers/rest.jpg"><h4>by Ottessa Moshfegh | September, 2020</h4><br>
	<p>Ottessa Moshfegh’s <em>My Year of Rest and Relaxation</em> is the strangest book I never expected to love (except that I respect the friend who recommended it to me a lot, so maybe I did, but there were definitely some points of doubt …). From my understanding of Moshfegh, she doesn’t like to be constrained by stereotypical characters or storylines and that is definitely clear in her 2018 novel. There is absolutely nothing to like about the completely disinterested narrator, her irritating and superficial best friend, or her on-again, off-again boyfriend who doesn’t even deserve that title. The character I enjoyed the most consistently through the novel was the protagonist’s airheaded psychiatrist who is certifiably crazy, which is saying something. Yet, even with such an unpromising set of characters, Moshfegh manages to create something as intensely meaningful as it is completely bizarre.</p>
	<p>At its center, at least from my art-inclined mind, was a questioning of how art represents life and how life is preserved by art. The narrator, as a recently graduated art history major working at an art gallery and occasionally acting as a certain artist’s muse, is completely immersed in this world of art. There is something dead, literally and figuratively, and without a soul in this world though, which, along with several other factors, leads her to want to hibernate for a year. Yes - the narrator, emulating the true spirit of ennui, decides she is going to completely disengage from the world for an entire year. The hope is that after a long, drawn-out sleep, she will be reborn with a new outlook on and enthusiasm for life. While a fantastical plan, the root feeling of just wanting to not exist for a day, or longer, is one to which a lot of people can relate.</p>
	<p>What’s remarkable, and maybe unbelievable, is that the narrator achieves her goal. While the tone of the novel changes after her year, the narrator doesn’t lose any of herself from before the sleep - her rude and sarcastic nature is evident even in the least significant moments as she opens back up to the world. I found this character preservation to be so rewarding. Maybe she’s not perfect, but she is a good person, despite her flaws. The book reminds readers that regardless of who you are, you can be a good person, which is a message I appreciated hearing.</p>
	<p>To bring the discussion back around to art, though, one of the first places the narrator goes after her year is to an art museum to “see what other people had done with their lives” (284). There, she experiences a slew of emotions that result from spending time with art. Whereas before, she had no connection to art, as she saw it only used as a means to achieve fame or status, now, it is raising in her questions which get at the meaning of life. More importantly, they help the narrator realize a new energy in herself to take her life into her own hands and live in the moment. Whether or not this message resonates with you, what’s important is the power of art to help us accept our past, realize our present, or push us into our future. As someone who assigns a lot of value to art for this reason, I found this scene to be one of the most moving in the entire book.</p>
	<p><em>My Year of Rest and Relaxation</em> is not what everyone looks for in a novel, but that quality makes it all the more interesting of a read. It achieves what every modern artist aims to do, which is create something that has never been done or seen before. There is so much more that could be said to make that argument for the book, but I am tired now and it would be more fun for you to experience the thought provoking escape of a novel for yourself. If you are able to accept the absurdity, you might find a strange, new, and unpredictable love in Moshfegh’s <em>My Year of Rest and Relaxation</em>.</p><br>

	<h3>The Upstairs Wife: An Intimate History of Pakistan</h3>
	<img align="right" class="cover-right" width="350" src="./assets/bookcovers/upstairs.jpg"><h4>by Rafia Zakaria | September, 2020</h4><br>
	<p>One of my main goals as I have started reading more in the past half year has been to read more stories that are different than my own. Of course, this goal is very vague, but nevertheless has encouraged me to pick up books written about different parts of the world or by authors coming from different parts of the world than from which I am. My desire to expand my worldview - excuse my being cliché - through books is likely rooted in the inability to travel for the foreseeable future. While I’m not sure reading can entirely replace personal experience in the form of travel, there is still lots to gain from reading about the experiences of those surrounded by entirely different cultures, cities, religions, and more. It is for this reason that I picked up Zakaria’s <em>The Upstairs Wife: An Intimate History of Pakistan</em>. Weaving together the biographical story of the author’s aunt, Amina, whose life is turned upside down when her husband takes a second wife, and the story of the political turmoil that has held Pakistan since the country’s founding in 1947, Zakaria manages to make the history of a nation, which for any country can be dry, personal and compelling.</p>
	<p>What I found most interesting about reading this book was tracking the growth of the city of Karachi, where the majority of the story takes place, for a couple of reasons. First, is that I am currently taking a class on urban development after WWII in the United States. Though the class has just started, already we have discussed the role of city planners in the development of different neighborhoods. As is touched upon in Zakaria’s novel, because of the newness of the nation, there was no sort of planning that went into the development of Karachi. While city planning had significant negative implications in the US, the scope of the opposite issue is seen when Zakaria notes that there did not exist a reliable map of Karachi even into the early 2000s. Having been in India a year and a half ago, I found myself drawing on my knowledge of Delhi as comparison. I am relatively unfamiliar with the planning, or lack thereof, that went into Delhi, but while there, it was impossible not to notice the uncontrolled urban settlements. These settlements are major strains on the city, but it cannot be forgotten, as pointed out by the personal stories of Zakaria, that these places are home to massive numbers of people who often have no other “home” to return to should they be removed. Integrating her own history into the history of the growth of Karachi creates a sense of compassion for the inhabitants of these often forgotten places. It is so easy to overlook the human story in neighborhoods that seem to only bring trouble to a city, so this reminder is much needed.</p>
	<p>I am by no means an expert on Pakistani history now. However, I do feel I have a knowledge about the founding and evolution of the country, as well as its relations with the surrounding areas, that is more or less equivalent to my knowledge of that of European countries. Considering the emphasis of high school history classes on Europe, it is unsurprising that my knowledge of European history is so much greater than that of the Middle East and Asia, even despite the importance of these regions to the politics that affect my daily life. As I navigated the complexities of Pakistan’s history through Zakaria’s novel, the importance of teaching this history became more and more pressing to me. Without a proper understanding of cultures besides our own, it is easy to generalize a population based on what is fed to us by our own government. The ignorance this method of information exchange promotes only leads to greater divisions between communities. By opening oneself up to another culture through reading, we can take down, book by book, brick by brick, the walls built up between people.</p>

	<h3>The Forty Rules of Love</h3>
	<img align="right" class="cover-right" width="350" src="./assets/bookcovers/forty.jpg"><h4>by Elif Shafak | September, 2020</h4><br>
	<p>Shafak’s <em>The Forty Rules of Love</em> is the puzzle piece that fits perfectly between her preceding and succeeding novels, <em>The Bastard of Istanbul</em> and <em>The Architect’s Apprentice</em> respectively. Not only does the reader see her development as a writer, but they also see a clear evolution of purpose and theme over the three works. Together, they explore ideas about love, trust, culture, religion, learning, and growth, each revealing something new about the divisions and connections between these subjects.</p>
	<p>I find Shafak’s writing so pleasant to read because of the complexities of her descriptions of characters, settings, and feelings. The reader really sees that quality of hers grow over these three novels. Starting with <em>The Bastard of Istanbul</em>, which follows a story more rooted in the modern world than the other two, the reader sees glimpses of greatness in Shafak’s descriptions of food, the city of Istanbul, and fiery characters like Zeliah and Asya. Moving to <em>The Forty Rules of Love</em>, the reader begins to see more of these moments of vivid depiction of both the modern world we know and the ancient world Shafak fills in for us. Finally, the reader arrives at <em>The Architect’s Apprentice</em>, which seems to be almost a study of characterization and imagery because of the gorgeous depth Shafak dives into with her language in this 16th century story. This clear development is beautiful to enjoy as a reader and gives a clear purpose with which to approach each book.</p>
	<p>Furthermore, the similarities in themes explored between these three works makes them wonderful to read in conjunction with another, as they build on one another in their messaging. In particular, <em>The Forty Rules of Love</em> focuses on, you guessed it, love! It is a religious perspective on love, though, drawing influence from the strong spiritual and cultural ideas of <em>The Bastard of Istanbul</em>, making it an almost transcendental read. Shafak employs the “Forty Rules of Love” written by Shams of Tabriz, a 12th century Sufi and dervish, to progress the reader through dual stories about the encounters with love of Sufi poet, Rumi, and fictional modern-day mother, Ella. As Ella’s part of the story picks up, the reader is hit with ideas about a more human love, which relies more on trust and instinct - ideas that are further explored in <em>The Architect’s Apprentice</em>. Shafak, through these three novels, links stories of the modern and ancient world, of different religions and cultures, through the common experience of love. While each novel focuses on a particular aspect of how love is expressed, at the center of it all is, appropriately, <em>The Forty Rules of Love</em>, which emphasizes most of all how it connects.</p>
	<p>After enjoying these gems of literature, I am looking forward even more to reading Shafak’s newest novel, <em>10 Minutes, 48 Seconds in This Strange World</em>. I cannot wait to get lost again in her enchanting language and captivating plots, all while discovering something new about myself and the world around me. Shafak’s writing deals with themes that are so relevant to my life and carries ideas that align very well with my own in a style that is so beautiful to me, which is likely why I enjoy reading her works so much. I feel a striking closeness to Shafak in the way we think, only she is able to express those thoughts in words, whereas I turn to movement. For this reason, I truly believe Elif Shafak is a literary genius, who continues to impress with such fantastic work.</p><br>

	<h3>Normal People</h3>
	<img align="right" class="cover-right" width="350" src="./assets/bookcovers/normal.jpg"><h4>by Sally Rooney | September, 2020</h4><br>
	<p>As I’ve been forced to spend a lot more time with myself recently because of the pandemic, I have spent a lot of time thinking about the internal and external factors in my life that make me happy. It has been scary to realize how much more I depend on external factors, namely other people, to bring me happiness than any internal factor. I feel weak in my awareness of how much I depend on the people around me. Bringing both comfort and distress to my mind with respect to this subject is Sally Rooney’s <em>Normal People</em>. In the novel, Rooney explores the related lives of two friends, for lack of a better description, Marianne and Connell, from high school up until they are about to begin graduate school. As suggested by the title, neither of our main characters feel as if they are “normal people,” bringing into question what it means to be “normal.” On the surface, this question seems shallow, because who ever feels like a completely normal person, but Rooney doesn’t stop at the shallow. She develops complex characters that in many ways the reader will relate to, and in many more ways they will not, which allows her to explore more deeply whether or not their habits are or should be considered normal.</p>
	<p>A significant portion of <em>Normal People</em> is dedicated to describing the evolution of the feelings of our characters over the 5 year course of the book. Included less often in those feelings than many would want to be considered normal is happiness. Hence, bringing to the front of my mind my own  consideration of what things make the “normal” person happy. It is comforting to read how much joy both Marianne and Connell derive from their friendship and time spent together, because, as mentioned, I find myself depending heavily on my friendships, albeit those with fewer benefits, to make me happy. However, disconcerting is the deep depressions these characters fall into when they are apart or on bad terms. My lived reality right now has been more disconnected from friends, resulting in more frequent feelings of sadness and loneliness. I want to believe this is the normal thing, as Rooney is clearly trying to indicate to the reader that it is just by making it a subject of the book, but seeing as both our characters suffer from mental health issues, I fear it may still be unhealthy. These thoughts are a complete regression back to my late high school years, when I became very interested in the science of happiness as I sunk deeper into my own mental health issues.</p>
	<p>There is so much more that could be discussed when it comes to the plot, characters, themes, etc. Rooney’s writing makes the reader wonder at what it means to grow as a person and if that growth is inherently good, how much change a single person can create in the world, and how socioeconomic status affects not only one’s experience, but also their perception of the world. My only critique is that the language was relatively plain, which makes <em>Normal People</em> a quick and easy read, but as someone who appreciates maybe unnecessarily embellished sentences, I wish the writing had been a bit more complex. Rooney develops interesting characters in other ways, but I think the novel could have benefitted just slightly from more elaborate language. In every other way, Rooney’s <em>Normal People</em> was a wonderful read that went deeper than the typical young adult novel, making it unique and more powerful in its message.</p><br>

	<h3>City of Girls</h3>
	<img align="right" class="cover-right" width="350" src="./assets/bookcovers/girls.jpg"><h4>by Elizabeth Gilbert | August, 2020</h4><br>
	<p>I had come to believe that I just couldn’t strongly dislike a book - until I picked up Elizabeth Gilbert’s <em>City of Girls</em>. Everything about this novel is frivolous, from its characters to its themes to its plot lines. The novel felt so out of touch with the era in which Gilbert sets the novel, namely the 1940s at the height of World War II, which was more of an issue for me, I believe, because it is being told from the perspective of an older Vivian Morris looking back on her life. The fact that even in hindsight Vivian is more concerned with how drop-dead gorgeous she is than her brother dying in the war makes her a very irritating narrator. Her regrets, which are mostly not having <em>more</em> sex, serve to prove over again how disconnected she is. Vivian’s entire character culminates in a statement on how our flaws don’t have any weight when judging character, which definitely did not redeem her or the book at all for me.</p>
	<p>I can’t deny that I finished this 466 page monster of paper in three days. Honestly, though, I think that has more to do with having quite literally nothing else to do while mostly isolating due to the pandemic. I couldn’t count the number of times I put the book down mid-chapter because I couldn’t deal with such a frustrating narrator, only to pick it back up a short while later because I was bored. By the end, I just desperately wanted to know who Angela’s father was, but even that plot line, which was lost in a sea of useless tangents, was dissatisfying by the end. The moment Vivian met Angela’s father was so predictable, but the book dragged on for so long, I got no satisfaction when it was finally revealed that I had guessed correctly.</p>
	<p>Maybe I am being too harsh on the book. I went into <em>City of Girls</em> expecting a lighter read. Unfortunately, it just missed the mark in so many ways. Instead of escaping the real world, I was just frustrated by how our narrator was entirely removed from it, taking away from much of the joy of light reads. After reading <em>City of Girls</em>, I don’t think I’ll be picking up any of Gilbert’s other books.</p><br>

	<h3>Americanah</h3>
	<img align="right" class="cover-right" width="350" src="./assets/bookcovers/americanah.jpg"><h4>by Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie | August, 2020</h4><br>
	<p>With the unequal treatment of people of color, and specifically the Black community, living in the US at the forefront of many American’s minds right now, Adichie’s <em>Americanah</em> was a very timely read. Both validating and critical of many different aspects of American culture, Adichie brings to light very unique perspectives on race, mental health, and immigration. Because the protagonist, Ifemelu, is a Nigerian immigrant to the US, she is able to draw attention to issues with American culture that go unnoticed by those for whom it is so normal. While her character can be insensitive, and at times just mean, her brutally honest opinions make you think, regardless of whether or not you agree with them.</p>
	<p>The book resonated with me so much because it hit close to home - literally. Much of <em>Americanah</em> takes place in University City, where I am a student, and on the Main Line, where I went to elementary through high school. The location and characters in these parts of the book were so vivid to me because I knew them. Ifemelu was highly critical of a lot of these characters, which forced me to reflect on my own life. Because I did not live on the Main Line, and my parents were not natives of the Philadelphia suburbs, I often felt like an outsider, which allowed me to be more critical of the area, in my mind. However, Ifemelu reminded me that it is still where I spent very formative years and many of the faults of the area are ingrained in me too. I appreciate how <em>Americanah</em> encouraged growth in that way.</p>
	<p>Of course, these ideas are all wrapped up in a passionate and challenging love story. Whether you like Ifemelu or not, there’s no denying that you want her to end up with her soulmate, Obinze. The reader’s investment in their relationship keeps you moving through the novel. Adichie’s mastery is in how she ties together the love story with messages about culture. Without spoiling the book, the resolution of Ifemelu and Obinze’s relationship was less satisfying than I expected because it was shadowed with cultural implications. Whether I am deserving of this response or not, I was frustrated at how easily one can change because of different cultural influences. Of course, it is natural and not always a bad thing. The conclusion, normally settling, only contributes to the many debates in the reader’s mind in a way that completes Adichie’s <em>Americanah</em> perfectly.</p><br>

	<h3>How to Get Filthy Rich in Rising Asia</h3>
	<img align="right" class="cover-right" width="350" src="./assets/bookcovers/asia.jpg"><h4>by Mohsin Hamid | August, 2020</h4><br>
	<p>Hamid’s <em>How to Get Filthy Rich in Rising Asia</em> is probably the most different of all the fiction I’ve read this summer. While I normally gravitate towards books with elaborately beautiful language, Hamid’s sentences are short, to the point, and minimally embellished. This perfectly frank style of writing, though, mixed with a dry sense of humor and a big dose of reality makes <em>How to Get Filthy Rich in Rising Asia</em> effective in its own way.</p>
	<p>With such concise language, the reader gets to know the essence of our unnamed characters, and how it changes over their lifetime, in a relatively short novel. This intimate care for the characters was unexpected for me considering the novel is soaked in humor that toes the line between tasteful and crude. Even as someone who doesn’t normally go for less-than-subtle jokes about sex and farts, I found myself smiling along to this book because of how well such jokes fit with the writing style. Besides this type of humor, Hamid’s style is quick to reference the harsh reality of life, which is emphasized in <em>How to Get Filthy Rich in Rising Asia</em> with the author’s breaking of the third wall. Speaking directly to the reader, Hamid is able to poke fun at every situation our characters face, without compromising any of these characters’ personalities. In this work, it works incredibly well to maintain the laid-back style of writing, while making the lives of the characters realistic.</p>
	<p>Despite the lighthearted nature of the work, <em>How to Get Filthy Rich in Rising Asia</em> does manage to get at some pretty big themes - one of the most interesting to me being the connection between an author, a story, and a reader. Introduced under the humorous guise that self-help books are of no help to anyone, it does not at first jump out to the reader as being particularly meaningful. In this way, the book is brilliant in its subtlety. Only after the reader has developed a deep relationship with the narrator does Hamid hit the reader with several insightful conclusions. All in all, I am shocked by how much more I enjoyed this book than I anticipated after the first chapter. For a good laugh, a genuine smile, and even a tear in your eye by the end, <em>How to Get Filthy Rich in Rising Asia</em> is the perfect read.</p><br>

	<h3>To the Lighthouse</h3>
	<img align="right" class="cover-right" width="350" src="./assets/bookcovers/lighthouse.jpg"><h4>by Virginia Woolf | August, 2020</h4><br>
	<p>Always exciting to me is drawing connections between literary works. Sharing themes which question the meaning of life, the importance of a legacy, and the purpose of art, are Woolf’s novel, <em>To the Lighthouse</em>, and Wilder’s play, <em>Our Town</em>. Both works emerged out of the modernist movement of the early twentieth century, which took particular interest in daily life and natural occurrences, especially death. The fascination with “normal” is unsurprising in this time period considering “normal” had been massively interrupted by the first and second World Wars, as well as the Spanish flu and, later, the Great Depression. These similarities, as well as some stark differences, really struck me about the two works.</p>
	<p>As an artist (or maybe more accurately nowadays, an avid art enthusiast), I find it interesting when a work questions the role of art in society. While it is not a main idea of <em>Our Town</em>, one of the play’s most iconic lines is “Emily: ‘Does anyone ever realize life as they live it … every, every minute?’ Stage Manager: ‘No. Saints and poets, maybe … they do some.’” Just as poets are more aware of life, Lily Briscoe, a self-proclaimed artist and friend of protagonist Mrs. Ramsay in Woolf’s <em>To the Lighthouse</em>, is somehow more aware of, and at the same time more removed from, the life of the Ramsay’s. Lily, then, becomes almost a 3rd person narrator, despite her presence in the memories she recalls, because she is so observant and passive in her relationship to life. Subsequently, her painting becomes an interesting subject because it is an attempt to capture the energy of life as a static object. As such, it is interesting to see her finish the painting she started so many years prior at the end of the work because it signals to the reader her success in making a life - a moment - permanent, despite the impossibility of doing so. It speaks to the importance of art, from painting to literature, in expressing and recording feelings of a certain time period, in the world or in a lifetime, which would otherwise remain completely unknown to future generations.</p>
	<p>Where the works differ is in how they ask and answer the question, “What is the point of life?” While there is a major death in both works, they are addressed very differently. <em>Our Town</em> takes on the perspective of a character who has died in an attempt to highlight how miraculous life is. On the other hand, <em>To the Lighthouse</em> considers more closely the effect of death on the life of several characters. The conclusions of a living and a dead person on such a question are, naturally, different. While <em>Our Town</em> suggests to the audience that none of us are fully living, <em>To the Lighthouse</em> focuses more on how the idea of “fully living” differs from person to person. In the wake of a death, the characters of <em>To the Lighthouse</em> must cope with loss, which helps each character realize what is most important to them. To some, it is the pursuit of knowledge, while to others it is expression through art or poetry. I very much appreciate Woolf’s acknowledgement that this question has many different answers, as this conclusion feels more valuable to the human experience.</p>
	<p>Of course, <em>To the Lighthouse</em> also contains all of Woolf’s signature stream-of-consciousness writing style that makes the novel a slow, but engaging read. Flowing effortlessly between narrators, Woolf captures beautifully the thoughts and emotions which go through a person’s mind on a daily basis. It is comforting in how it highlights both the similarities and differences in  the way human minds can think. Each of us can relate in some way to every character, which I find beautiful. Woolf’s ability to highlight our common experiences, which we often do not voice for fear of being ostracized, makes her novel relatable, even almost 100 years after it was published. For this reason, Woolf’s novels remain relevant to the human experience today - a further testimony to the powerful ability of art to connect and beg the big questions in life which plague us all.</p><br>

	<h3>Just Mercy</h3>
	<img align="right" class="cover-right" width="350" src="./assets/bookcovers/justmercy.jpg"><h4>by Bryan Stevenson | July, 2020</h4><br>
	<p>After reading <em>Just Mercy</em>, the reason for Stevenson’s success as the founder of the Equal Justice Initiative (EJI), which works to get wrongly imprisoned men, women, and children out of jail and off of death row, is undeniably clear. Because of his education and full commitment to his work, he is able to articulate exactly how the US justice system is broken and most damaging to poor communities of color. He uses facts and precedents in the US and across the globe to illustrate how dire the situation is, without being abrasive in his presentation. Voices like Stevenson’s are essential in opening up conversations about reform to those who don’t necessarily see or understand the direct impact the broken system has. It also equips those who may already have a sympathetic view with the evidence necessary to convince others of the massive injustices occurring. Stevenson’s book should be required reading for students across the country, as it is incredibly important for all US citizens to realize how racism continues to live in our society, even after the Civil Rights Movement.</p>
	<p>Personally, I was blown away by the passion with which Stevenson works and writes. He gave his whole self over to the cause of combating racism in our justice system not only by representing unjustly incarcerated people, but also by providing emotional support to those clients and their family members. I am sure he often doubted himself and felt overwhelmed by the work, as alluded to a few times in the book, but his strength, level-headed demeanor, and passion kept him pushing forward. Furthermore, he has the incredible ability to inspire others through his words. Before reading the book, I wouldn’t have expressed strong feelings about the death penalty, but now I feel incredibly strongly about making it illegal and feel well-equipped to argue that opinion. Stevenson is exceptionally talented with words, which, coupled with his passion for the work, makes him a voice we must be amplifying in the US right now.</p><br>

	<h3>Mrs. Dalloway</h3>
	<img align="right" class="cover-right" width="350" src="./assets/bookcovers/dalloway.jpg"><h4>by Virginia Woolf | June, 2020</h4><br>
	<p>As we go through the motions of our daily life, we are filled with thoughts ranging from what flowers to buy at the shop to whether or not we can completely know another person. The differences in people’s thoughts are undeniable, but there is more similarity in the human experience than is obvious on the surface, as Virginia Woolf beautifully illustrates in her fourth novel, <em>Mrs. Dalloway</em>. Seeing these thoughts, which can often feel overwhelming, written out on paper is comforting in a strange, but unsurprising way. Both times that I read <em>Mrs. Dalloway</em>, it felt extremely timely for me and provided a sense of calm to the chaos of life - qualities which likely explain why the book has remained relevant after so many years.</p>
	<p>A signature of Woolf’s is her stream of consciousness writing style which floats her from character to character as they pass by each other on the street, notice the same car or tree, or attend the same dinner party. The choice to narrate in this way is extremely effective in achieving the sense of connection she sets out to in writing <em>Mrs. Dalloway</em>. It reminds the reader that every person on Earth, even if you’ve never met them, lives a life as full and deep as your own. Any feelings you have were felt before and will be felt again, even if not by you. At times when life is overwhelming, this realization keeps me grounded, as I know it is and forever will be true of the world. While it is not particularly revolutionary, neither are the majority of our daily thoughts. What is more important is how it informs our behavior, as is so clearly demonstrated in <em>Mrs. Dalloway</em>. </p>
	<p><em>Mrs. Dalloway</em> is not a quick or easy read, but digging deep into Woolf’s language is rewarding in the sheer beauty of the phrases and the feelings they evoke. Furthermore, her ability to draw out a connection between characters with such vastly different life experiences and then with the reader as well is incredible. <em>Mrs. Dalloway</em> both reflects our own mind and reminds us of the commonality of the human experience. This blend is not one you see often because of how difficult it is to achieve - a testimony to Woolf’s literary mastermind.</p><br>

	<h3>The Architect's Apprentice</h3>
	<img align="right" class="cover-right" width="350" src="./assets/bookcovers/architect.jpg"><h4>by Elif Shafak | June, 2020</h4><br>
	<p>Facing reality has been a challenge recently, with a global pandemic raging across the US and the tragic reality of police brutality against the black community coming to light. <em>The Architect's Apprentice</em> has been a much needed refuge from the harshness of our own world. With her poetic language, Shafak beautifully transports us to Istanbul during the peak of the Ottoman Empire. Relaying imagined stories of real historical characters, it is easy to lose yourself in this imperfect, but still fantastic world. The gorgeous imagery - a signature of Shafak's writing - at the same time makes me want to travel to see the cities described myself and gives the feeling of having visited already through her words. For this reason, I found myself smiling through the whole book. How could you not fall in love with a city in which "stories [leave] the palace on pistachio carts" and of "easy forgettings... [where] things are written in water?" Adding to the charm of the story were the historical references. I was encouraged by reading the novel to learn more about the Islamic faith with their whirling dervishes and imposing mosques. I found myself constantly pausing my reading to look up pictures of architecture or articles explaining the difference between Sufi, Sunni, and Shi'a Islam. Had it not been for my inspired divergences from the reading, I would have finished this book much faster than the two weeks it actually took me. Furthermore, it was fun to connect characters to places I had visited and experienced for myself. In particular, I remember reading the name Humayan, a Moghul Emperor in the 16th century, and recalling a trip to Humayan's Tomb - known as the Little Taj - in Delhi. These added tidbits of history woven together beautifully into the storyline made Shafak's novel all the more fun to read.</p>
	<p>While the novel is not driven by plot, I really appreciated how I could float through the story and still feel like I gained something by the end. Having read a couple of her works now, it is clear that Shafak takes inspiration from the tradition of oral storytelling, in which stories with strong moral lessons are passed down from generation to generation. The influence is especially evident in <em>The Architect's Apprentice</em> because of the strong overarching themes Shafak brings to the forefront of the reader’s mind towards the end of the book. Without being dramatic or direct, Shafak reminds us what it takes to love, trust, and learn, which ultimately moved me to tears. The novel was sweet, without being cheesy, and asked the big questions, without being overly philosophical - a balance which made <em>The Architect's Apprentice</em> a wonderful read.</p><br>

	<h3>The Bastard of Istanbul</h3>
	<img align="right" class="cover-right" width="350" src="./assets/bookcovers/bastard.jpg"><h4>by Elif Shafak | May, 2020</h4><br>
	<p>Shafak’s style is distinct, enchanting, and undeniably clear in the novel known to be one of her best, <em>The Bastard of Istanbul</em>. Because of the gorgeous imagery used in the novel, it is appropriate to say that Shafak paints the story of an Armenian-American girl from the United States and a Turkish girl from Istanbul. While it is difficult to imagine a connection between two people living so far apart and coming from two cultures with such a tumultuous relationship, dating back to the Armenian Genocide in the early 1900s, Shafak’s doing so is arguably the most important message of the story. It is so easy to get caught up in the differences between two groups of people, but Shafak masterfully employs particular storytelling techniques in <em>The Bastard of Istanbul</em> to remind readers of how much more we have in common than not. The first technique that I was able to recognize was the choice to write each chapter from a different character’s point of view. The reader subconsciously begins identifying with pieces of each character’s personalities, making the story all the more engaging and fun to read. I was able to connect with one character because she did ballet, admire another for her spunkiness and strength, identify with another for her curiosity and desire to travel - the list goes on. By developing these relationships between the characters and the reader, it makes the connections between characters very easy to understand, despite their unlikelihood.</p>
	<p>Second was Shafak’s many descriptions of food throughout the novel. Food is something that, for almost all of us, represents the bringing together of people. Whether that be during family dinners, late night snacks, or more tragic events such as funerals, there is an undeniable uniting power in gathering around familiar meals. The most sweet and touching moments in <em>The Bastard of Istanbul</em> are often accompanied by food, as Shafak attempts to further highlight our interconnectedness in this way. Lastly, Shafak weaves in stories of the past to the two girls’ present to prove that, even though we may have been told different stories of it, we all share the same history. While the past is arguably the most divisive subject in the story, it also proves the most powerful connection by the end. Of course, there are other elements of the novel, such as religion and the characters at a café, which nod to our interconnectedness as well. Each little, but well thought out, piece of the novel comes together to form a delightful story that anyone can enjoy, which is likely why Shafak’s book has been so well received across the globe.</p><br>

	<h3>The Witch Elm</h3>
	<img align="right" class="cover-right" width="350" src="./assets/bookcovers/witch.jpg"><h4>by Tana French | May, 2020</h4><br>
	<p>There is so much to appreciate about French’s <em>The Witch Elm</em>, with its complex characters and unexpected plot twists, all captured with incredibly descriptive language. While it is not explicitly a crime fiction novel, as many of French’s other works are, she employs the same careful crafting of characters required of such a genre to create a novel with unique character exploration. The complexity of the characters is matched only by the language in <em>The Witch Elm</em>. French manages to find a gorgeous way to state even the most obvious, with particular attention to detail. Her writing evokes a wonderful sense of beauty about the work, which makes <em>The Witch Elm</em> an albeit long, but interesting read.</p>
	<p>French’s mastery in <em>The Witch Elm</em> is by far her ability to develop the lingering question of “what is the true extent of Toby’s injuries?” throughout the book without feeding any definitive answers to the reader. Because it is written entirely from Toby’s perspective, the reader never gets an objective picture of how Toby is recovering - or what his baseline character was really like before his injuries, for that matter. Along with Toby, the reader convinces themself that he is basically the same person as he was before, minus a bit of vocabulary. Melissa’s response to his behavior later in the book, though, suggests that he has changed a great deal due to his injuries. Since Toby is our narrator, though, there is no real way to know if his own self-image as a generally good person is inflated, if the injuries significantly changed him, or if he is the same good person as before suffering in an unfortunate situation. French’s ability to suggest each of these three possibilities without strongly favoring any of them is a moment of brilliance in <em>The Witch Elm</em>.</p>
	<p>Looking past the beautiful language, the deep psychological development of each character, and the perfect (#goals, if I were one to hashtag) relationship between Toby and Melissa, the plot is a little weak. Especially towards the end of the novel, the situation becomes less and less believable. As a reader, I accept that I am giving up a certain understanding of reality and taking on what the author has created, but the final big events seem out of place in French’s world. It reads more as if French needed an excuse to wrap up the story a certain way and in doing so betrayed the personalities of some of her carefully crafted characters. For that reason, I was not wholly satisfied with the final fifth of the novel, but <em>The Witch Elm</em> is still worth the read for everything French does with her complex prose and incredible character development.</p><br>

	<h3>The Pilot's Wife</h3>
	<img align="right" class="cover-right" width="350" src="./assets/bookcovers/pilot.jpg"><h4>by Anita Shreve | May, 2020</h4><br>
	<p>Although recommended to me by my mother and Oprah, I read <em>The Pilot’s Wife</em> largely because we had a copy at my house and I was looking for a new book. While the subject matter was interesting, as the uncertainty in the life of a pilot’s wife is not something I would have thought about, the book itself didn’t excite any strong emotions or insightful realizations. Left without a clear sense of hope, sadness, or connection, Shreve’s <em>The Pilot’s Wife</em> conflicted me in ways I don’t think she intended.</p>
	<p>One of my deepest conflicts about the book is the relationship between the pilot’s wife, Kathryn, and her recently deceased husband, Jack’s, co-worker, Robert. I wanted to be supportive of the obvious emotional connection between Kathryn and Robert, especially considering the shocking situation Kathryn is faced with in the wake of such a devastating time and Robert’s kindness. Then I am reminded of the fact that they met because of Jack’s death and the idea of their relationship becomes inappropriate. I can’t shake the feeling that they are both somehow taking advantage of each other’s sadness. Is it a good thing, though, if this brings both of them a sense of happiness? This plotline overshadowed, I believe, a lot of the more interesting questions the book is set up to ask, which is why it was such a point of dislike for me.</p>
	<p>With that said, the plot moved me quickly through this book. The end of each chapter kept me reading into the next, which is important to consider in one’s enjoyment of a book. Furthermore, it brought to life an interesting history which I knew little about, so I appreciated that aspect of the book. <em>The Pilot’s Wife</em> was not a life-changing read, but not every book has to be. It was perfect to enjoy on the beach in North Carolina, but certainly not my new favorite novel.</p>

	<h3>One Amazing Thing</h3>
	<img align="right" class="cover-right" width="350" src="./assets/bookcovers/amazing.jpg"><h4>by Chitra Divakaruni | April, 2020</h4><br>
	<p>I remember buying this book from the local book store at the beach probably three years ago. I picked it up as a beach read, but never got around to actually starting it. It's a good thing I didn't, though, because this book had me bawling - which would not have been a cute beach look! Divakaruni’s <em>One Amazing Thing</em> hit so close to home at this point in my life because of the situation the world is in right now with the covid-19 pandemic. With more time to think, I have become more philosophical and have been asking myself big questions, as the characters in the novel do, about life, love, and friendship. Furthermore, I am realizing who is most important to me, just as the characters in the book realize, in a situation in which it is no longer easy to be in touch with those most important people. Of course, in my case, the pandemic is less extreme than the life or death situation the characters in the book face as they are trapped in a below ground building blocked by an earthquake. Nonetheless, I was able to connect to the helpless and lonely emotions they were experiencing, which made the book all the more impactful for me. Being a big book cryer, those emotions got the best of me most evenings as I read the book.</p>
	<p>I also love Divakaruni’s idea of “one amazing thing” that can almost be used to define our lives. Young or old, we can all think of at least one amazing thing that has occurred in our life that we would not be the same without. I place a lot of importance on the thing we go to sleep and wake up thinking about. Whether that be a person, something that happened to you, whatever, we can all pretty easily pinpoint the one thing that occupies our mind the most. I imagine that each of our amazing things is somehow connected to the thing we go to sleep and wake up thinking about. <em>One Amazing Thing</em> indulged this way of thinking, which I really appreciated. The book was not extraordinary, but it was an interesting thought experiment I enjoyed traveling through, especially at this point in my life.</p><br>

	<h3>Educated</h3>
	<img align="right" class="cover-right" width="350" src="./assets/bookcovers/educated.jpg"><h4>by Tara Westover | March, 2020</h4><br>
	<p>With a title as powerful as <em>Educated</em>, the reader has very specific ideas about what will be discussed in Westover’s first novel. Glowing recommendations did not help with lowering these expectations in me for the book. That said, I can definitively write that Westover completely smashed any and every expectation I had for <em>Educated</em> in the best way possible. Addressing not only the power of an education, but also the effects of mental illness on a person and their family, Westover’s <em>Educated</em> is a raw and thought-provoking story unlike any other.</p>
	<p>There are so many brilliantly incorporated themes in this work, ranging from access to mental health treatment to the strength of family relationships, but the one I found to be most impactful was the questioning of how a history is told. Given Westover’s background as a historian, with a PhD from Cambridge nonetheless, she brings a unique perspective as she tells her own story. One consequence of her heightened awareness of this question was that she offered as unbiased of a perspective on her own life as possible. The effect of this perspective is two-fold. First, Westover becomes a very trustworthy narrator for the reader, which is needed considering the extremity of some of the stories she tells. Second, the writing clearly contributes to the conclusion Westover reaches with the reader about her subconscious choice to cope with an abusive childhood by convincing herself that she simply misremembered a number of situations. While an uncomfortable subject, Westover’s growth through the novel brings to light the importance of finding healthy coping mechanisms and staying true to oneself.</p>
	<p>The weight of the topics covered in the novel has made <em>Educated</em> my go-to general book recommendation to anyone that asks (and doesn’t!). The novel takes on enough plot to be interesting for those who normally go for fiction, but is rooted so deeply in Westover’s reality that it will more than please those looking for a non-fiction read. Furthermore, the messages that Westover emphasizes in the book are incredibly important reminders of the many forms of personal strength. While the circumstances that brought her to such powerful conclusions are more extreme than most experience, they are no less applicable to the average reader’s life. For these reasons, Westover’s <em>Educated</em> is the must read book of our generation, especially in the US.</p>
