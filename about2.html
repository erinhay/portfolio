        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <br>
        <p>Hi, and welcome to my portfolio! My name is Erin, but you can call me Hayes.</p>
        <br>
        <p>I am a junior at the University of Pennsylvania studying physics, with a concentration in astrophysics, and minors in design and math. In addition to the BA, I will be submatriculating and recieving my MS in physics. On campus, I am a Vagelos Scholar and a member of Arts House Dance Company, West Philly Tutoring Project, Women in Physics, Penn Astronomical Student Association, and the Annenberg Center Student Advisory Council. I also serve as the Chair of the Dance Arts Council. In addition, I work in the Department of Physics & Astronomy under Masao Sako as a research assistant.</p>
        <br>
        <p>When I'm not studying, I enjoy attending the ballet and the orchestra, wandering through art museums, playing the piano and the guitar, checking cities off of my travel bucket list, cooking very involved meals, or just curling up with a good book and a cup of tea. I am always looking for ways to engage with art, whether that be directly by creating through music, dance, or design, or indirectly by reading, watching, or listening. This site is one more avenue for me to express myself.</p>
        <br>
        <p>xoxo</p>
