        <h4>Emily Sachs Dance Benefit 2021</h4>
        <br>
        <div class="vid">
            <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rNuIZ3XYrUM" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

        <br>
        <p>Although unqiue from all past Em Sachs performances, myself, Hannah Lottenberg, and the entire Dance Arts Council Community came together virtually for the 25th Annual Emily Sachs Dance Benefit. The performance, which raises money for CHOP&rsquo;s Community Asthma Prevention Program (CAPP+), happened in the form of a YouTube livestream, linked above.</p>

        <br>
    
        <p>As in 2020, I was involved in Em Sachs as the Artistic Chair. The role presented new challenges than I had faced with design in the past, as I did not have video or photo content with which to create. As such, I reused content from the past five years of shows to market the livestream. Also unique to this year, I worked with India Abbott at the Annenberg Center, who edited the video together. She was an absolute joy to collaborate with on the show. This year, we managed to raise over $4,500 for CHOP CAPP+, an incredible achievement given the circumstances of which all of DAC should be proud.</p>

        <p>In January of 2020, I had the honor of working with Hélène Chesnais, Éloïse L&rsquo;Her, and Hannah Lottenberg on the 24th Annual Emily Sachs Dance Benefit. The show brought together the 12 Dance Arts Council groups at the University of Pennsylvania to raise money for the Community Asthma Prevention Program Plus (CAPP+) at CHOP in memory of Emily Sachs, a Penn student who passed away from asthma complications in 1995. While at Penn, Emily was a member of Arts House Dance Company and a vibrant member of the dance community.</p>

        <br>
    
        <p>I served as Artistic Chair, so my responsibilites were to create marketing and show content for the performance. This content included posters, transition videos between dances during the show, and social media marketing posts. Together, Hélène, Élo, Hannah, and I raised $7,000 for CHOP CAPP+. Seeing so many people come together for a cause close to the hearts of everyone in DAC was so inspiring to me. I can say without a doubt that working on Em Sachs 2020 was one of my favorite experiences at Penn.</p>

        <p>Founded in 2015 by Ramita Ravi (UPenn CAS &lsquo;18), Penn Summer Dance Series is dedicated to bringing dance to Penn&rsquo;s campus over the summer. Classes are open to anyone, regardless of their level of experience, and taught on a volunteer basis by students and members of the Philadelphia community. In the summers following, the Series lived on thanks to dancers who volunteered to organize the twice-a-week classes.</p>
        <br>
        <p>In 2019, I took over the role of coordinator, after seeking out opportunties to dance on Penn&rsquo;s campus over the summer. In addition to Penn, the 2019 Series attracted teachers from Rutgers, Drexel, and the greater Philadelphia community. By mid-July, Penn Summer Dance Series became so popular, that Fridays were added to the normal schedule of Monday and Wednesday workshops. As a result, we held a total of 24 workshops, the most in any summer to date - almost doubling the number of classes from 2018! With a Facebook group of almost 900 dancers, the Series continues to grow, even amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, with initiatives such as the Penn &ldquo;Quarantine&rdquo; Dance Series. There is great hope for our joining together again to celebrate dance in the summer of 2021.</p>
