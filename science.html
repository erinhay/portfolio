    <h3>My Project</h3>
	<p>I work in the Department of Physics & Astronomy under Dr. Masao Sako as a research assistant. We are currently working on a project with the goal of constraining the contribution of solar mass size black holes to the total dark matter in our galaxy.</p>

	<h5>A measurement of the equation of state of carbon envelopes of white dwarfs</h5>
	<h4>Kritcher, A.L., …, Glenzer, S.H. <em>Nature</em>, 584 (2020), pages 51-54</h4><br>
	<p>Collapse into a white dwarf is the dramatic death awaiting most stars on the main sequence. With a mass comparable to that of the Sun, but a radius comparable to that of the Earth, a white dwarf is extremely dense, having a core pressure of a million to a billion times that of the Earth’s atmosphere. It is incredibly difficult to reach and measure the properties of this high-density state, so we have not been able to constrain with certainty theoretical models of white dwarfs. As such, our predictions of the properties of white dwarfs can vary by up to 10%.</p>
	<p>This paper focuses on one class of white dwarf, called hot DQ stars, which are surrounded by an envelope of carbon. Kritcher et al aimed to collect data on the pressure-versus-density, or equation of state (EOS), function of carbon at atomic pressures extreme enough to ionize the inner-core electron orbitals of the sample and change the shape of the EOS function. The EOS gives information on how compressible the material is and the interplay between the ionization energy and interaction in the plasma, so this data would help in our understanding of several characteristics of hot DQ stars, such as their pulsation pattern.</p>
	<p>The authors present new laboratory measurements of the equation of state at atomic pressures greater than 300 Mbar - a great improvement from previous maximums of ~60 Mbar. They claim that this data will enable tests of theoretical models at pressures exceeding 100 million atmospheres. Preliminary interpretations of the data do clearly point out that theoretical predictions of the EOS which include electronic shell structure are in better agreement with the measurements than other proposed models.</p>
	<p>This pressure regime is not only important because data has not been recorded here before, but also because it reaches into the bottom of what is called the “convection zone” for hot DQ stars. This region is responsible for the unstable pulsation modes of hot DQ stars and is where models of EOS show the most variability. Therefore, there is great hope for the data presented in this paper to contribute to more accurate models of white dwarfs, and specifically hot DQ stars.</p>

	<h5>The tidal remnant of an unusually metal-poor globular cluster</h5>
	<h4>Wan, Z., …, DeSilva, G.M. <em>Nature</em>, 583 (2020), pages 768-770</h4><br>
	<p>With big data becoming a more prominent field in science, the idea that we may, in some cases, not have the data we need to completely understand a system is somewhat surprising today. However, I have found this lack of data or tools to collect the data we need to be a common theme among several papers I have read this summer. Two weeks ago, I wrote about a shockingly large soft-shelled egg, but is it really that shocking if soft-shelled eggs are poorly preserved and so, in hindsight, would be a rare finding anyways today? Last week, the article I read was about biodiversity in Antarctica. The authors pointed out that the majority of biodiversity was in human-populated areas of Antarctica, but we have explored so little of the continent, how can we know it is only these regions in which a diversity of species exists?</p>
	<p>Finally, we come to this week’s article on the metallicity of globular clusters, or bound stellar structures which contain some of the oldest stars in a galaxy. Wan et al report that the ratio of iron to hydrogen in all but one star in the Phoenix stellar stream (which was originally identified in the Dark Energy Survey (DES) - the data I use for my project!) is significantly lower than the predicted lower bound on metallicity of stars in globular clusters. This predicted value comes from the idea that a globular cluster would not have survived until today unless the stars were able to fuse iron, an indicator of the star’s life expectancy. Considering the fact that globular clusters are by our current definition some of the oldest structures in the universe, it does not make sense that the Phoenix stellar stream be young. Having worked with DES data, I am familiar with its limitations, despite being a state-of-the-art survey. As such, it is possible that all the current data we have points to the definition of globular cluster as is, but there is clearly a flaw in that model. It will be interesting to follow whether or not even more sensitive telescopes will find more examples of low metallicity globular clusters and how our understanding of globular clusters will evolve with that new data. I find it fascinating how data and data collecting technologies are at the same time exploding in our world and still limiting our understanding of science.</p>

	<h5>Antarctica’s wilderness fails to capture continent’s biodiversity</h5>
	<h4>Leihy, R., …, Chown, S. <em>Nature</em>, 583 (2020), pages 567-571</h4><br>
	<p>In 2009, I became a mother when I adopted a beluga whale from the World Wildlife Fund through their “symbolic species adoption” fundraising initiative. The stuffed animal gift and adoption certificate that came with the donation were, of course, not as important to a nine year-old me as the conservation efforts I was supporting. This childhood interest in wilderness conservation was sparked again upon reading the article by Leihy et al in Nature on biodiversity in Antarctica. The authors first compiled data on human activity in Antarctica since its discovery in 1819 in order to identify the level of impact humans have had on regions across the continent. Then, they consider the legal definition of “wilderness” and whether or not it is used appropriately when describing Antarctica. Finally, they examine the effect of the legal designation of “wilderness” on biodiversity conservation efforts in Antarctica.</p>
	<p>Due to its climate and location, human activity in Antarctica has been limited over the past 200 years. As such, the vast majority of the continent has had only transient or no human visitation, which on the surface suggests a negligible human impact on the region. Several existing definitions of wilderness, based on human population density and industrial, urban, or agricultural use, would designate 99.57-100% of Antarctica to be wilderness. However, using data from the Antarctic Terrestrial Biodiversity Database, the authors find these wilderness regions to exclude all sites of high biodiversity value. It is clear from this research that the label “wilderness” does a poor job describing the conservation value of the continent. The authors urge efforts to improve biodiversity data without compromising the condition of the Antarctic wilderness to better our understanding of the conservational value of the Antarctic wilderness. Thus, the most valuable regions in Antarctica will be able to be appropriately protected from the growing and diversifying human activity on the continent.</p>
	<p>Should there be any fundraising efforts to support biodiversity conservation in Antarctica, I will gladly donate to the cause, as it has been a passion of mine for so long. I only hope my generous contribution would be acknowledged through a gift of a tote bag, t-shirt, or photo. </p>

	<h5>A giant soft-shelled egg from the Late Cretaceous of Antarctica</h5>
	<h4>Legendre, L., ... , Clarke, J. <em>Nature</em>, 583 (2020), pages 411-414</h4><br>
	<p>Despite what my extensive lower-school rock collection may lead you to believe, the world of geology is relatively unfamiliar to me. Research in the field does not typically grab my attention, but news of a giant dinosaur egg with unusual characteristics is impossible to ignore. Of course, in order to understand what is so unusual about this eggshell, one must have an idea of the characteristics of a normal eggshell. In their paper, Legendre et al. first break down the structure of both hard- and soft-shelled eggs, which animals each type typically belongs to, and how their fossils are classified. Following this introduction, they explain what makes this newly discovered giant soft-shelled egg such an interesting find.</p>
	<p>All eggshells, both hard and soft, consist of three layers - an outer calcareous layer, a proteinaceous membrane, and a thinner boundary layer. Hard-shelled eggs, which typically belong to dinosaurs, crocodiles, and turtles, have an outer calcareous layer that makes up most of the thickness of the shell. On the other hand, soft-shelled eggs, belonging to lizards and snakes, have a reduced calcareous layer and a thicker proteinaceous membrane, organized into bundles of protein fibrils. Geologists are able to classify fossilized eggs as either hard- or soft-shelled based on the thickness of the calcareous layer, which is normally the only part of the eggshell to be preserved. Interestingly, common chemistry techniques, such as electron microscopy, X-ray spectroscopy, and mass spectroscopy, are used to confirm the identification of the fossil as an egg and to describe the microstructure of the layers. </p>
	<p>You may now be wondering, “what about this newly discovered fossilized eggshell is so unique?” For starters, it is the first fossil egg to be found in Antarctica and, at over 700g, the second largest egg in the UT, Austin sample. Images of the approximately 800 micrometer thick shell revealed a much thicker membrane than outer calcareous layer, indicating that the egg must be soft-shelled. The kicker is that the only species that such a large egg could belong to is the typically hard-shelled egg laying dinosaur! The finding points to a systematic bias against the preservation of soft-shelled eggs and the likely undersampling of large, soft-shelled eggs.</p>

	<h5>Blood factors transfer beneficial effects of exercise on neurogenesis and cognition to the aged brain</h5>
	<h4>Horowitz, A.M., Fan, X., …, Villeda, S.A. <em>Science</em>, 369 (2020), pages 167-173</h4><br>
	<p>Social distancing due to the global pandemic has had a range of “side effects” on our physical and mental health over the past four months. In particular, isolating in one’s home has reduced the amount of activity one gets in a day for most. For many over the age of 65, an increased susceptibility to the virus has resulted in an even more severe reduction in daily activity, which is a main source of exercise for this age group. Exercise is incredibly important to mitigating the effects of aging on the brain, so this reduction in activity could have a significant effect on the physical and brain health of older people. The paper by Horowitz et al aimed to pinpoint the ways exercise affects the aging brain with the hope of identifying new therapeutic approaches to mimic those effects for those that are unable to exercise as easily. </p>
	<p>First, the authors assessed the age-related impairments to brain activity in the hippocampus in aged mice relative to young mice. Then, an independent group of aged mice were allowed access to a running wheel for 6 weeks, after which their brain activity was compared to the control group to confirm that exercise improved cognition in the hippocampus. It was then tested whether or not the benefits of exercise could be transferred by administering exercise-induced circulating blood factors to sedentary aged mice. It was found that injection of plasma from active aged mice into sedentary aged mice improved neurogenesis in the hippocampus relative to a control group injected with only saline. Focus then turned to identifying specific exercise-induced blood factors that caused this change in the hippocampus. Specifically, Gpld1, a liver-derived circulating blood factor, was found to be an important part of the process of improving cognition, suggesting more research should be done on this factor and its effect on human hippocampus function.</p>
	<p>While this study poses an interesting potential solution to overcoming the difficulty of exercising for the elderly, it is unlikely that it will be effective and accessible soon enough to help those whose health has been negatively affected by the pandemic. Right now, it is incredibly important that we practice social distancing to limit the spread of the virus. By doing so, we not only protect ourselves, but also those around us, including high-risk groups, such as the elderly, from sickness and other long term effects, such as reduced activity.</p>

	<h5>Thermal bottlenecks in the life cycle define climate vulnerability of fish</h5>
	<h4>Dahlke, F., …, Pörtner, H.<em>Science</em>, 369 (2020), pages 65-70</h4><br>
	<p>With global warming continuing to heat up Earth’s atmosphere and bodies of water, researchers are concerned for the well-being of species that only have a narrow tolerance range of temperatures in which they can survive. Oftentimes, temperature sensitivity changes throughout an animal’s life - the most sensitive periods of which are referred to as life cycle bottlenecks. While scientists have studied this feature in many animal species, the life cycle bottlenecks for fish remain largely undefined. The study by Dahlke et al. explored the thermal tolerance over time of 694 marine and freshwater fish species from all climate zones and the causes for narrower tolerance in certain life stages.</p>
	<p>They find that most species of fish have narrower tolerance when they are spawning adults or embryos, which agrees with the oxygen-limitation hypothesis that suggests a link in aerobic capacity and tolerance to extreme temperatures. Specifically, tolerance is observed to increase from the embryo phase to the larval and adult phases likely because of the development of cardiorespiratory organs, but then decreases again when the fish becomes able to spawn because of a theorized increased demand for oxygen during gamete production. Although the narrowing around embryo and spawning adult phases is consistent across species, the width of these tolerance ranges is not - likely due to differences in local conditions.</p>
	<p>The paper focused on the effect of these life cycle bottlenecks on the species’ ability to reproduce. Because one of the sensitive phases is the spawning phase, reproductive success is at risk with global warming. Using simulations of climate projections, the research by Dahlke et al suggests that by 2100, the number of fish species affected by water temperatures exceeding their tolerance limit for reproduction may range from 10-60%. These effects may cause fish to reproduce at different times of the year and in different places, potentially posing additional risks to the survival of the embryos. Climate change could, therefore, have potentially devastating effects on fish populations and increased efforts must be made to stabilize global warming.</p>

	<h5>A planet within the debris disk around the pre-main-sequence star AU Microscopii</h5>
	<h4>Plavchan, P., …, Zilberman, P. <em>Nature</em>, 582 (2020), pages 497-500</h4><br>
	<p>Being young and cool aren’t the only things that make pre-main-sequence star AU Microscopii interesting for further studies on stellar evolution. The star, with the appropriately hip nickname of AU Mic, has been found to be the home of at least one planet newly identified by NASA’s Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) mission and the Spitzer Space Telescope. The planet, with an orbital period of 8.46 days, orbital distance of 0.07 AU, a radius of 0.4 Jupiter radii, and a mass of less than 0.18 Jupiter masses, coexists with AU Mic’s debris disk. A debris disk, as the name implies, is a disk of dust and debris that surrounds a star at a radius of anywhere between 10 and 100 AU. While there are around 900 stars with confirmed debris disks, AU Mic is special in that it is a red dwarf star, which do not often have debris disks. Moreover, having a Neptune-sized planet in addition to a debris disk makes AU Mic especially unique. To date, there are no other known stars with these characteristics.</p>
	<p>I enjoyed reading about AU Mic in the article by Plavchan et al because it focused on the research possibilities of the system. In particular, due to its proximity, brightness, and geometry, AU Mic will be an ideal candidate for studying the early stages of dynamical, thermal, and atmospheric stellar evolution, as well as the relationship between planets and debris disks. Additionally, studies of the system have already provided important insights into several mysterious mechanisms. First, AU Mic and its planet have confirmed that gaseous planet formation occurs over a period of fewer than 20 Myrs. Second, dusk clumps, which have been observed to be ejected at high speeds from the system, are likely to be remnants of the primordial debris disk ejected by the planet. Further studies on the spin-orbit obliquity of the planet are being carried out to confirm this hypothesis. Lastly, comparison to other stars, of the same stellar age with debris disks, will allow for interesting conclusions about planet formation. The wealth of information that has the potential to be extracted from AU Mic and its planetary and debris disk companions make the planet an incredibly exciting find.</p>

	<h5>Potential circadian effects on translational failure for neuroprotection</h5>
	<h4>Esposito, E., Li, W., Mandeville, E. T., …, Lo, E. H. <em>Nature</em>, 582 (2020), pages 395-398</h4><br>
	<p class="note">*Note: this response was recognized as a top submission for the week of June 22nd.</p><br>
	<p>Humans are not rats. However, many drugs (for humans) are first tested on rats before moving into clinical trials. The authors, puzzled by why some drugs that work in rats do not work in humans, consider the effect of different circadian rhythms on the efficacy of neuroprotectants, or drugs that protect against or help repair the damaging effects of a stroke. The vast majority of testing of rats happens during the day, when the nocturnal animals are less active. Humans, on the other hand, mostly have strokes when they’re most active, during the day. This discrepancy is the subject of research in the paper.</p>
	<p>First, they considered the treatment normobaric hyperoxia (NBO), which worked in rodents, but not in clinical trials. They found the therapy was effective during rodents’ inactive phase, during the day, but not during their active phase, at night. It should be noted that for NBO, surgeries happened in the daytime and nighttime, so the operator’s performance may have been systematically decreased while testing the active phase. For subsequent drugs, precautions were taken to minimize human error in daytime versus nighttime surgeries by housing the animals with either normal or reversed light schedule and only performing surgery during the day. Still, a second treatment that failed in clinical trials, αPBN, was found to be ineffective during the rats’ active nighttime phase, despite its promising effectiveness during the inactive daytime phase. A third drug, NMDA, was tested to confirm the generalizability and produced similar results. The authors then tested two drugs that were effective in clinical trials and found little difference in their efficacy in rats during the active and inactives phases.</p>
	<p>This article was slightly humorous for me to read because of course some drugs that worked in rats won’t work in humans. But I have to admire the authors’ attempt to pinpoint the specific differences that have the biggest effect on the two responses. By taking the precaution suggested by the authors of testing neuroprotectants during both the active and inactive phases of rats, clinical trials may be safer and more successful. It should be kept in mind though, as the authors note, that there are other differences between rats and humans that may result in this discrepancy. Specifically, they point to age as a potential culprit.</p>

	<h5>Variability in the analysis of a single neuroimaging dataset by many teams</h5>
	<h4>Botvinik-Nezer, R., Schonberg, T., <em>Nature</em>, 582 (2020), pages 84-88</h4><br>
	<p>I am both surprised and not surprised by this paper by Botvinik-Nezer et al, which attempts to quantify the variability of the results of an analysis due to the analytical choices made regarding the data set. The study was set up as follows: 70 teams were assigned the task of analyzing a data set using methods they would typically use in their labs and report whether each of nine hypotheses were found true or false. None of the pipelines used to analyze the data were the same - which I find amazing. There was great variability in the results reported due to the differences in these pipelines. The authors found that, averaged over all hypotheses, 20% of teams reported an answer divergent from the majority of teams. This 20% statistic falls midway between complete consistency across all teams and completely random results. When I first read this statistic and its meaning, I was slightly mortified.</p>
	<p>Of course, on the surface it makes sense that different approaches will result in different results. At the same time, it is also shocking that results should not be consistent over many different analyses. It is difficult to accept that human choices have such a significant impact on a study, because we want to believe that it is purely the data giving us results. The ideas of statistical significance and reproducibility instill a feeling of confidence in a study because it indicates to a reader that a study can be trusted, but that idea may be mistaken. Botvinik-Nezer et al calls into question the confidence and trust given by the labels “statistically significant” and “reproducible,” especially for studies using a single analysis pipeline.</p>
	<p>The implications of this research stretch far beyond medicine, although at arguably lower stakes. Data analysis is an important part of any computational research projects, including my own. A large part of my day-to-day work is testing data cuts that will remove all unlikely microlensing candidates, without also throwing out good candidates. The findings of my research, and so many similar projects before it, are entirely dependent on the analytical choices made for a data set. As I read papers and conduct my own analysis, I will keep in mind this paper and be more skeptical of the analytical choices I make.</p>

	<h5>Olfactory sniffing signals consciousness in unresponsive patients with brain injuries</h5>
	<h4>Arzi, A., Sobel, N., <em>Nature</em>, 581 (2020), pages 428-433</h4><br>
	<p>My first question when reading the title of this article was, “why the olfactory system?” The authors briefly justify this choice by explaining how olfaction relies on the same structures in the brain as are involved in the basic mechanisms of arousal. They hypothesize that olfaction may be able to probe consciousness because of this connection to arousal. If the newly developed olfactory tests are as accurate as the authors claim, one would believe that arousal is an essential part of consciousness and in the prediction of whether a patient who suffered brain injuries will wake up again. Therefore, a patient with injury to this part of the brain is very unlikely to wake up again. I wonder if there have been any studies on the effect of brain injury to the part of the brain associated with olfaction and arousal and, if so, how the results compare to those found in this article. Is there any chance that a test of a different region of the brain would predict a different subset of people to regain consciousness?</p>
	<p>The paper also outlines the general setup of the study. After a session of olfactory testing, the patient’s level of consciousness is assessed using “standard clinical measures.” The ambiguity of this description may be due to my lack of knowledge of medical practices, but it raises in me again the question of what part of the brain is really being tested. If the standard clinical measures to determine whether a patient is unresponsive (UWS) or minimally conscious (MCS) - the two classes patients were split into - are probing only the part of the brain involved in arousal, and therefore olfaction, it makes perfect sense that such a clear correlation should be found in the two. Furthermore, the abstract states that there is a 40% error in determining the state of consciousness, so I am not loving that a metric with such a huge margin of error is used to classify the two groups. In that same vein, I wonder if any of the patients originally believed to be in one state was found to be in the other based on their results in the olfactory test. Since the article claims the responses during UWS sessions were so much different than the responses during the MCS sessions, I imagine one would be able to differentiate between the two groups, as the authors did on the single patient level with a threshold, within some range of error.</p>

	<h5>A cold, massive, rotating disk galaxy 1.5 billion years after the Big Bang</h5>
	<h4>Neeleman, M., Rafelski M., <em>Nature</em>, 581 (2020), pages 269-272</h4><br>
	<p>The article by Neeleman, Prochaska, Kanekar, and Rafelski discusses the recent observation of six massive disk galaxies at redshift z ~ 4, half of which appear to be rotating. This is an interesting finding because the formation of such massive rotating galaxies is not predicted by current models of the early universe. While the current model can account for the formation of massive galaxies early on in the universe, through mergers of smaller galaxies or the flow of gas along filamentary structures into the galaxy, these processes do not predict that the massive galaxies would ever become hot enough to rotate. Based on their findings, the authors conclude that cold, rotationally-bound, massive disk galaxies formed in the early universe do exist, so more research must be done into the process by which they might form. We must be skeptical of the study, though, as even the authors say the evidence that the galaxies are rotating is tentative. Because image resolution decreases with distance, and high redshift sources are very far from us, it is more difficult to estimate a galaxy’s inclination and rotational velocity. With that said, the study is sufficiently convincing due to the overlapping data drawn from several telescopes with varying resolving power.</p>
	<p>My research is interested in primordial black holes (PBHs), or black holes formed in the early universe. There is yet to be any direct evidence of the existence of PBHs and the process by which they are formed is even more mysterious. Both the disk galaxies discussed in the article and PBHs are much more massive than models of the early universe expect. The process by which such massive structures could have formed so early on in the lifetime of our universe is incredibly interesting to me - and has major implications for astronomy. I wonder if more research into the formation of massive rotating disk galaxies will improve our understanding of how PBHs could have formed. If such progress led to direct evidence of PBHs, in the Cosmic Microwave Background for example, my research project would become a hot topic of astronomy, which is very exciting.</p>

	<h5>Rapid growth of new atmospheric particles by nitric acid and ammonia condensation</h5>
	<h4>Wang, M., Kong, W., Marten, R. et al., <em>Nature</em> 581 (2020), pages 184–189</h4><br>
	<p class="note">*Note: this response was recognized as a top submission for the week of May 18th.</p><br>
	<p>The research article by Wang, Kong, Marten, et al. discusses the mechanism by which the particles that make up smog are able to grow faster in urban settings compared to other environments. Considering the effect that smog and otherwise poor air quality can have on one’s health, the article was interesting for its relevance to COVID-19. Preliminary studies by Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health have shown higher levels of air pollution can lead to increased risk of death from COVID-19. By understanding the mechanism of smog particle growth in urban environments, we might be able to reduce the pollution of cities and, as a result, improve the health of those living in cities and the health outcomes in future crises.</p>
	<p>The study focused on the effect of new-particle formation on the presence of smog in cities. Particle formation is thought to predominantly involve sulfuric acid, so the researchers looked at how different processes of oxidation to sulfuric acid affects particle growth. In cities there is a higher than average concentration of nitrogen dioxide, so it was added in observationally accurate ratios to strong base, sulfur dioxide, and ammonia. The researchers found that with nitrogen dioxide present, particles began to grow twice as fast as they did in trials without nitrogen dioxide once they reached a threshold size determined by the temperature of the environment. As a result, the particles accelerated through a range of sizes referred to as the “valley of death,” in which particles have a hard time growing. This finding explains why smog can tend to build up more quickly in urban settings.</p>
	<p>As I was reading the article, it seemed surprisingly familiar. The speeding of the particles through growth phases reminded me of inflation in the early universe. Although on vastly different scales, there is a common theme between the two processes, that being a short window of time during which a small structure is able to grow at unprecedented rates. I always enjoy finding common threads throughout different fields of science, so it was interesting to draw that connection between this research and my prior knowledge.</p><br>
