	<h3>AHTAHs Winter 2019</h3>
	<p>I had a lot of fun choreographing to lemin.'s "View of It All." A lot of my prior contemporary choreography has a strong ballet influence, but the music moved me to try something different last December. A little more sexy and a little more cool, I really enjoyed taking on a different style of contemporary than is typical for me.</p><br>

	<h3>Arts House Dance Company Presents: Clickbait</h3>
	<p><em>Clickbait</em>, Arts House Dance Company's Fall 2019 show took place on November 22nd & 23rd. For the show, I choreographed a jazzy piece that really pushed me out of my comfort zone. Although the process of getting to the show was not perfect for me, I am so pleased with the energy and enthusiasm my dancers brought to the stage. Check out my piece, "Like a Girl" below!</p><br>

	<h3>Penn Summer Dance Series 2019</h3>
	<p>Founded in 2015 by Ramita Ravi (UPenn CAS '18), Penn Summer Dance Series is dedicated to bringing dance to Penn's campus over the summer. Classes are open to anyone, regardless of their level of experience, and taught on a volunteer basis by students and members of the Philadelphia community. In the summers following, the Series lived on thanks to dancers who volunteered to organize the twice-a-week classes.</p><br>
	<p>In 2019, I took over the role of coordinator, after seeking out opportunties to dance on Penn's campus over the summer. In addition to Penn, the 2019 Series attracted teachers from Rutgers and Drexel. By mid-July, Penn Summer Dance Series became so popular, that Fridays were added to the normal schedule of Monday and Wednesday workshops. As a result, we held a total of 24 workshops, the most in any summer to date - almost doubling the number of classes from 2018! With a Facebook group of almost 900 dancers, the Series continues to grow, even amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, with initiatives such as the Penn "Quarantine" Dance Series. There is great hope for our joining together again to celebrate dance in the summer of 2021.</p><br>
	<p>Check out the playlist icluding videos from all of our summer 2019 classes below!</p><br>

	<h3>AHTAHs Spring 2019</h3>
	<p>Check out a combo I choreographed to Oh Wonder's "High on Humans - Abbey Road Session." Choreographing this combo was emotional, but healing and watching it come to life on close friends really helped me process what was going on in my life at the moment.</p><br>

	<h3>AHTAHs Winter 2018</h3>
	<p>AHTAHs, or Arts House Teaches Arts House, are a series of workshop-style classes held by Arts House Dance Company at the end of every semester. Company members may opt in to teaching a dance class of whatever style they want. As a freshman, I wanted to dip my toes into the waters of choreography, so I took the oportunity to choreography my first real contemporary combo to Trent Dabbs' "Set For Life." Everyone who took the class was so supportive and made my first glimpse into choreography and teaching dance wonderful!</p><br>
